<h1>Simple Firewall in Python</h1>

<p>This Python project implements a simple yet effective firewall that provides several security features, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Worm Detection and Prevention:</strong> Protects your network against worm attacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Trojan or Botnet Traffic Detection and Prevention:</strong> Identifies and blocks suspicious traffic associated with trojans and botnets.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Intrusion Detection:</strong> Detects and prevents unauthorized access attempts.</li>
    <li><strong>Spam Blocking:</strong> Filters out spam traffic to keep your network clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-Jammer Measures:</strong> Includes measures to mitigate jamming attacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Before running the code, make sure you have the required Python packages installed. You can do this by running:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Open the <code>main.py</code> file.</li>
    <li>Update the <code>IP</code> and <code>PORT</code> variables with your desired configuration. These settings define the IP address and port where the firewall will be active.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Running the Firewall</h3>

<p>To run the firewall, execute the following command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 main.py</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once the firewall is running, it will actively monitor and protect your network based on the configured rules and security measures.</p>
